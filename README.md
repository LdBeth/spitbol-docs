## Documentation

http://github.com/spitbol/spitbol-docs

This directory contains the documentation files for Macro SPITBOL.

These documents rarely change.

### [The SNOBOL4 Programming Language](docs/green-book.pdf) by R. E. Griswold, J. F. Poage and I. P. Polonski.

This is the classic "Green Book" (because of the cover of its color). It is a marvel of typography, and first
introduced the use of "beads" to explain SNOBOL pattern matching.



### [MACRO SPITBOL: The High-Performance SNOBOL4 Language](docs/spitbol-manual-v3.7.pdf) by Mark Emmer and Edward Quillen.

The SPITBOL project notes with sadness the death of Ed Quillen in June, 2012.
To quote from Mark Emmer's Acknowledgments in the SPITBOL Manual:

> Ed Quillen, local novelist, political columnist, and SNOBOL enthusiast, co-
authored this manual. He combined various terse SPITBOL documents from other
systems with Catspaw's SNOBOL4+ manual, while providing more complete
explanations of some concepts. Any observed clarity is this manual is due to
Ed, while the more opaque portions can be blamed on me.

You can learn more about Ed at [Ed's web site](http://www.edquillen.com/) and

home](http://www.denverpost.com/obituaries/ci_20781716/denver-post-columnist-
ed-quillen-dies-at-age).

### v37.min

`v37.min` is the source file for SPITBOL v3.7. It is the state of SPITBOL as of 2009 when
Dave Shields took over the maintainer role. The actual code in the current system is
very close to v3.7. The main difference is that the change history has been deleted, and
the MINIMAL specification formerly in this document can now be found in the file `minimal.md`

The supplied version of v37.min is just the source for SPITBOL converted from all upper case
to all lower case.


### minimal.md

`minimal.md` contains the specification of the MINIMAL language, based on the text in `v37.min`.
